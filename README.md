# Plant Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to detect plant diseases using image classification models. The system allows users to upload an image of a plant leaf, and the machine learning model predicts the disease affecting the plant.

## Features
- **Image Upload:** Users can upload an image of a plant leaf.
- **Disease Detection:** The system processes the image and predicts potential diseases using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- **Preventive Measures:** Provides recommendations to prevent plant diseases.
- **Responsive UI:** The interface is designed using Bootstrap for a clean and user-friendly experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **JavaScript Libraries:** TensorFlow.js, MobileNet
- **Machine Learning Model:** MobileNet (Pre-trained Model for Image Classification)
